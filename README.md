# ðŸŒŒ GitHub Trend Observatory

> A living archive of what the world builds, thinks, and stars.

Every week, thousands of developers cast their stars onto open-source projectsâ€”  
a silent, collective vote for what's relevant, beautiful, and powerful.

This project collects those signals.  
It stores them with care, analyzes them with curiosity,  
and presents themâ€”visually and accessiblyâ€”through a minimal interface.

All refreshed **weekly**, automatically.

## âœ¨ Why this project?

This project began as a question.

After taking an AI Chatbot course at Cornell University and watching NVIDIAâ€™s GTC Summit, I found myself immersed in the rapidly growing world of generative AI toolsâ€”vector embeddings, RAG pipelines, multi-modal models. 
But as the ecosystem expanded, so did my curiosity:

> How can we tell what is *actually* trending in open-source Gen AI?

Not just from headlines or hype, but from actual developer traction.

Thatâ€™s how I started building a GitHub Trend Trackerâ€”  
a tool that fetches metadata from top repositories, stores them efficiently, and visualizes weekly movements in the open-source AI landscape.

Itâ€™s my way of connecting what I learn in class, what I observe in the industry, and what I want to build as a developer.

This is only the first step: a minimal MVP with auto-updating data and a live dashboard.  
But it lays the groundwork for moreâ€”such as linking GitHub activity with arXiv papers, and exploring the narrative behind the data.
